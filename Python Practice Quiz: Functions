# This function compares two numbers and returns them
# in increasing order.
def order_numbers(number1, number2):
	if number2 > number1:
		return number1, number2
	else:
		return number2, number1

# 1) Fill in the blanks so the print statement displays the result
#    of the function call
smaller,bigger = order_numbers(100, 99)
print(smaller, bigger)

# Part Two
Let's revisit our lucky_number function. 
We want to change it, so that instead of printing the message, it returns the message. 
This way, the calling line can print the message, or do something else with it if needed. 
Fill in the blanks to complete the code to make it work.

def lucky_number(name):
  number = int(len(name) * 9)
  pr = "Hello " + name + ". Your lucky number is " + str(number)
  return pr

print(lucky_number("Kay"))
print(lucky_number("Cameron"))
